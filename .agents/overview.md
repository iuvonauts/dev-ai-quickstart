# Overview

## Goal
Provide a clean, standard quickstart repo that is ready for development in a
Dev Container with Codex integrated.

## Scope
- Keep the repo minimal and easy to clone.
- Document how to launch the devcontainer and where configuration lives.
- Use `src/` as the location for the real production repository.

## Key Paths
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: devcontainer definition.
- `README.md`: developer onboarding instructions.
- `AGENTS.md`: entry point for agent context.
- `.agents/`: deeper context and working notes.
- `src/`: production repo (separate git repository) lives here.
