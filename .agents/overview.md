# Overview

## Goal
Assist users in creating their first agent-assisted app.

## Scope
- Keep the repo minimal and easy to clone.
- Use `src/` as the location for the real production repository.

## Key Paths
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: devcontainer definition.
- `README.md`: developer onboarding instructions.
- `AGENTS.md`: entry point for agent context.
- `.agents/`: deeper context and working notes.
- `src/`: production repo (future separate git repository) lives here.
