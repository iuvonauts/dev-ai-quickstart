# Conventions

## Writing
- Keep docs concise and skimmable.
- Prefer ASCII unless a file already uses Unicode.
- Update `AGENTS.md` date when material changes.

## Code
- Favor small, readable changes with clear intent.
- Add brief comments only when logic is non-obvious.

## Tools
- Prefer `rg` for searches.
